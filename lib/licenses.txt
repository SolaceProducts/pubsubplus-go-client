GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]
Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By
contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and
change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially designated Free
Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can
use it for your libraries, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses
are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you
can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or
to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give
the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can
get the source code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide complete object files
to the recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the
library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you
this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that
there is no warranty for this free library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed
on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any
problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger
that companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License,
which was designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public License,
applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be
sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary
license.

The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction
we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program
with a library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
analogous to running a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and legal
sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the
ordinary General Public License treats it as such.

Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License for libraries did
not effectively promote software sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all
benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is
intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your
freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We
have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as
regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to faster
development of free libraries.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close
attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the
library". The former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only works together
with the library.

Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General Public License rather
than by this special one.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the
copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this
Library General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently
linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under
these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or
with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter,
translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a
library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they
are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output
from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library
(independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on
what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive
it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with
the Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer
warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work
based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section
1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files
and the date of any change.
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the
terms of this License.
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by
an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does
not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its
purpose remains meaningful.
(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely
well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application
does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are
not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute
them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,
whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written
entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
derivative or collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a
work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other
work under the scope of this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this
License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to
this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of
to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has
appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
these notices.

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU
General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is
not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in
object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you
accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then
offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along
with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work
with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".
Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the
scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a
derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that
uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for
distribution of such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library,
the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is
not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library,
or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by
law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and
small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables
containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the
work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a "work that uses the
Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that
work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the
customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that
the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the
work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the
Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also,
you must do one of these things:

a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library
including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2
above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete
machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user
can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified
Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)
b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user
the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing
this distribution.
c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer
equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.
d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already
sent this user a copy.
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and
utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary
libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you
cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single
library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a
combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of
the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined
with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on
the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else
grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions
are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing
the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works
based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient
automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or
modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for
enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other
reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from
the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,
then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,
the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in
other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right
claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license
practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the
author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and
a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest
of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by
patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under
this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this
License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Library General
Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of
this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the
terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution
conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software
which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the
free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.
SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT
HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA
OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE
LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we
recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by
permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary
General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to
the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file
should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.
Copyright (C) year  name of author

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
Library General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
License along with this library; if not, write to the
Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor,
Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a
"copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in
the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written

(c) If Licensee desires other rights for the Evaluation Software Release,
Licensee must request from SOLACE a commercial release of the Software. 

(d) The limited use license granted in subsection (a) will automatically expire
on the earlier of: (i) the date when the Software is made available to Licensee
as a commercially available product, and (ii) the date specified in the Order

Products, or (b) know-how, ideas, or any other subject matter protectable under
laws applicable to Intellectual Property Rights of any jurisdiction. As between
Licensee and SOLACE, SOLACE and its affiliates and licensors are the sole and
exclusive owners of the Products, including Intellectual Property Rights

4.2 Feedback.  Licensee is encouraged to provide to SOLACE suggestions,
comments and feedback related to the Products (including reporting bugs) (the

distribute, modify or otherwise adapt, incorporate into any software and
documentation, including the Products, and sublicense, without attribution or
compensation to Licensee, all Feedback which SOLACE receives or otherwise

or otherwise.  Licensee waives or will cause all moral rights to be waived in
any Feedback.

4.3 Third Party Licenses.  The Software may contain or require third party
software that is licensed under third party terms.  SOLACE may direct Licensee
to such third party terms, and in some instances the Software cannot be used or
further distributed without Licensee's acceptance of such terms.  Any
failure of Licensee to agree to the terms applicable to such third party
software may undermine certain functionality of or prevent Licensee from using
the Software.

4.4 Open Source Software.

(a) Licensee will not represent to third parties, or use any third party
software or code in conjunction with: (i)the Software; or (ii)any software,
products, documentation, content or other materials developed using the
Software, in such a way that: (A) creates, purports to create or has the
potential to create, obligations for SOLACE with respect to the Software; or
(B) grants, purports to grant, or has the potential to grant to any third party
any rights to or immunities under any Intellectual Property Rights of SOLACE,
as such rights exist in or relate to the Products.

(b) Licensee will not use any Software in any manner, including through
incorporation, linking, distribution or otherwise, that will cause any Products
and any Intellectual Property Rights therein to become subject to any
encumbrance or terms and conditions of any third party or open source license,
including any open source license listed on
http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical (each an "Open Source
License").

(c) The restrictions, limitations, exclusions and conditions referred to under
subsection (b) will apply even if SOLACE becomes aware of or fails to act in a
manner to address any violation or failure to comply therewith. No act by
SOLACE that is undertaken under this Agreement in respect to any Products will
be construed as intending to cause any Intellectual Property Rights that are
owned or controlled by SOLACE or any of its affiliates (or for which SOLACE or
any of its affiliates has received license rights) to become subject to any
encumbrance or terms and conditions of any Open Source License.

4.5 Use of Name and Logo  Licensee will not display or make any use of
SOLACE's or its affiliates' names, marks or logos without the prior
written approval of SOLACE.

6	CONFIDENTIALITY

6.1 Definition of Confidential Information. 

In this Agreement "Confidential Information" of a Party means any
information of a Party (including in respect to SOLACE any of its affiliates,
licensors, customers, employees or subcontractors) (the "Disclosing
Party"), whether oral, written or in electronic form, which has or will come
into the possession or knowledge of the other Party (the "Receiving
Party") in connection with or as a result of entering into this Agreement
that can reasonably be considered to be confidential in the circumstances of
disclosure or which is designated as confidential. The Products, any
performance information, service levels, support terms, and results of testing
of the Software, and the terms of this Agreement are Confidential Information
of SOLACE. Notwithstanding the foregoing, "Confidential Information" does
not include information that is:

(a) publicly available when it is received by or becomes known to the Receiving
Party or that subsequently becomes publicly available other than through a
direct or indirect act or omission of the Receiving Party (but only after it
becomes publicly available); 

(b) established by evidence to have been already known to the Receiving Party
at the time of its disclosure to the Receiving Party and is not known by the
Receiving Party to be the subject of an obligation of confidence of any kind;

(c) independently developed by the Receiving Party without any use of or
reference to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party as
established by evidence that would be acceptable to a court of competent
jurisdiction; 

(d) received by the Receiving Party in good faith without an obligation of
confidence of any kind from a third party who the Receiving Party had no reason
to believe was not lawfully in possession of such information free of any
obligation of confidence of any kind, but only until the Receiving Party
subsequently comes to have reason to believe that such information was subject
to an obligation of confidence of any kind when originally received; or

(e) Feedback provided by Licensee or a representative of Licensee.

6.2 Confidentiality Obligations.

(a) Each Party will, in its capacity as a Receiving Party: (i) not use or
reproduce Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose,
other than as may be reasonably necessary for the exercise of its rights or the
performance of its obligations set out in this Agreement; and (ii) not
disclose, provide access to, transfer or otherwise make available any
Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to any third party except as
expressly permitted in this Agreement.

(b) Each Party may, in its capacity as a Receiving Party, disclose Confidential
Information of the Disclosing Party: (i) if and to the extent required by a
governmental authority or otherwise as required by applicable law, provided
that the Receiving Party must first give the Disclosing Party notice of such
compelled disclosure (except where prohibited by applicable law from doing so)
and must use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Disclosing Party
with an opportunity to take such steps as it desires to challenge or contest
such disclosure or seek a protective order.  Thereafter, the Receiving Party
may disclose the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, but only to
the extent required by applicable law and subject to any protective order that
applies to such disclosure; and (ii) to: (A) its accountants, internal and
external auditors and other professional advisors if and to the extent that
such persons need to know such Confidential Information in order to provide the
applicable professional advisory services relating to the Receiving Party; and
(B) employees of the Receiving Party and its subcontractors if and to the
extent that such persons need to know such Confidential Information to perform
their respective obligations under this Agreement; 

provided that any such person is aware of the provisions of this Section 6.2
and has entered into a written agreement with the Receiving Party that includes
confidentiality obligations in respect of such Confidential Information of the
Disclosing Party that are no less stringent than those contained in this
Section 6.2.

6.3 Consent to Injunctive Relief.  Any unauthorized use or disclosure of the
Confidential Information of SOLACE, its affiliates or licensors may cause
irreparable harm and significant injury to SOLACE that would be difficult to
ascertain or quantify; accordingly Licensee agrees that SOLACE will have the
right to seek and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief to enforce the
terms of this Agreement and without limiting any other rights or remedies that
SOLACE may have.

7	WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.

7.1 Warranty.  SOLACE warrants that the Software will materially comply with
the Documentation during the Subscription Term.  If the Software does not
materially conform with the warranty in the prior sentence, provided that
Licensee is in compliance with the terms of this Agreement, and all
Subscription Fees are fully-paid up, SOLACE will provide the support to
Licensee in respect to the applicable Software to the extent set out in
SOLACE's then current Support and Maintenance Terms, and the provision of
support to correct the non-compliance with the warranty in this Section will be
Licensee's sole and exclusive remedy in the event of non-compliance with the
warranty in this Section by SOLACE.  All other support will be dependent on the
plan procured by Licensee, as defined in the Support and Maintenance Terms.

7.2 Disclaimers.

(a) EXCEPT AS SET OUT IN SECTION 7.1, THE PRODUCTS AND SUPPORT THAT MAY BE
PROVIDED BY SOLACE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, IS PROVIDED 'AS-IS' AND 'AS
AVAILABLE'. 

(b) Except as set out in Section 7.1, the Products and support are without any
additional warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, collateral,
statutory or otherwise. SOLACE does not warrant or make any representations
regarding the use, or the results of the use, of the Products in terms of its
correctness, accuracy, reliability, or otherwise. 

(c) SOLACE does not represent or warrant that the functionality of the Products
will meet Licensee requirements, or that the operation of the Products will be
uninterrupted or error-free, or that the Products  or any service enabled by
the use of the Software will always be available, or that defects in the
Products  will be corrected. 

(d) TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, SOLACE ON ITS OWN
BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSOR(S) EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL
WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABLE QUALITY,
MERCHANTABILITY, QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND
NON-INFRINGEMENT.

(e) Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so
exclusions in this Article 7 will apply only to the extent permitted by
applicable law.

8	LICENSEE INDEMNITY AND EXCLUSION.

8.1 Licensee Indemnity.

(a) Without limiting SOLACE's rights and remedies under this Agreement,
Licensee will indemnify, defend and hold SOLACE, its licensors, affiliates or
any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents (together, the
"Solace Indemnitees") harmless from and against any and all third party
Claims and Losses incurred or otherwise suffered by each SOLACE Indemnitee
arising out of, resulting from or related to:
(i) any use, reproduction or distribution of the Products (notwithstanding the
restrictions and obligations in this Agreement), as modified or integrated by
Licensee in Licensee application, which causes an infringement or
misappropriation of any Intellectual Property Right, publicity or privacy right
of any third parties arising in any jurisdiction anywhere in the world, except
and solely to the extent such infringement is caused by the unmodified
Software, or portions thereof, as supplied to Licensee by SOLACE under this
Agreement; or
(ii) any use, downloading, distribution, installation, storage, execution, or
transfer of the Products in breach of this Agreement.

(b) SOLACE may enforce the indemnity under this Article 8 on behalf of any or
all of the SOLACE Indemnitees. Licensee may only bring a Claim against SOLACE
and not any SOLACE Indemnitees under this Agreement.

8.2 SOLACE Indemnity.

(a) SOLACE will defend Licensee from and against any and all Claims by a third
party incurred or otherwise suffered by Licensee arising out of, resulting from
or related to a Claim that the Products licensed pursuant to Section 2.1
infringe or misappropriate third party copyright or patent rights in Canada or
the United States of America, and indemnity Licensee from any damages awarded
by a court of final determination.

(b) Without limitation, Section 8.2 will not be applicable and SOLACE will not
be liable to defend a Claim to the extent that such Claim is based on: (i)
Licensee's use of the Products after SOLACE notifies Licensee to discontinue
using them; (ii) Licensee combining the Products with non-SOLACE services,
products, programs or data; or (iii) Licensee altering or modifying the
Products. 

(c) If SOLACE receives information concerning an infringement or
misappropriation Claim related to the Products, SOLACE may, at its expense and
without obligation to do so, either: (i) procure the Intellectual Property
Rights or other right(s) to continue to use the Product; or (ii) replace or
modify the Product to make it non-infringing; or (iii) immediately terminate
this Agreement on written notice to Licensee, in which case SOLACE will refund
to Licensee, on a pro-rata basis, any pre-paid fees in respect to such Product
from the date of such termination to the end of the then current Subscription
Term for such Product; and this Section 8.2(c) states the sole and exclusive
remedy of Licensee and the entire liability of SOLACE for third party
infringement claims and actions.

8.3 Indemnification Procedures.  Each Party's obligations under this Article
8 are contingent on all of the following: (i) the Party seeking the indemnity
(the "Indemnified Party") must notify the other Party (the
"Indemnifying Party"), in a timely manner and in writing of the Claim;
(ii) the Indemnified Party must give the Indemnifying Party sole control over
defense and settlement of the Claim; (iii) the Indemnified Party must provide
the Indemnifying Party with reasonable information and assistance, at the

Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party for reasonable expenses
that the Indemnified Party incurs in providing that assistance).  The
Indemnified Party may choose to have its counsel, monitor or participate in the
defense of such a Claim provided that the Indemnified Party will be responsible
for the cost of its own counsel and the Indemnifying Party's obligations in
this Article 8 do not extend to the Indemnified Party's legal costs should
it wish to exercise such right. The Indemnifying Party will not be responsible
for any settlement made by the Indemnified Party without its prior written
consent.  The Indemnifying Party may not settle or publicize any Claim without
the Indemnified Party's prior written consent.

any such provision, right, or remedy in that or any other instance; rather, the

another term.

without affecting its application to other Parties or circumstances.

brought exclusively in a federal or provincial court located in Ottawa, Canada,
and Licensee hereby consents to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts.

effectively do so, the defence of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such action, application or proceeding.  The Parties will not raise any
objection to the venue of any action, application, reference or other
proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement in the federal or
provincial courts sitting in Ottawa, including the objection that the
proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum.  A final judgment in

other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner specified by
law.  The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
Goods is expressly disclaimed and will not apply.
